 I think what was stuff was not being able to talk to anyone because I don't think anyone understood what I was experiencing. So if I'd say I'm not feeling, I didn't know myself initially how to describe it. I've just all of these terms of, I knew what I was feeling but I don't think I was able to communicate entirely what I was feeling. Like I knew I had this British feeling in my stomach. I knew that I'd be scared to wake up. I didn't want to wake up. I wanted to always, you know, I found sleep. I found comfort in sleep because I felt like that was my escape. And like waking up was a struggle. I didn't, I didn't enjoy. And in fact, I think that's something I'm still scared of. I don't like the sound of an alarm.
